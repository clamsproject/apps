This CLAMS app aligns transcript and audio track using Gentle. Gentle is a robust yet lenient forced aligner built on Kaldi.This app only works when Gentle is already installed locally.Unfortunately, Gentle is not distributed as a Python package distribution.To get Gentle installation instruction, see https://lowerquality.com/gentle/ Make sure install Gentle from the git commit specified in ``analyzer_version`` in this metadata.
