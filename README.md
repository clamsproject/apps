## Repository naming convention

* Applications in the `clamsproject` organization should prefixed with `app-`. 
* An application that wraps an extant tool or application must be suffixed with `-wrapper`. 
* `LICENSE` file should always contains licensing information of the terminal tool. If the terminal tool is a wrapper, an additional file containing licensing information of the original tool must be placed next to the `LICENSE` file when the original license requires so.
